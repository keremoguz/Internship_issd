## Regression Models
- I first tried to implement regression models from scratch such as linear and polynomial regression.
- I used the data in csv files as It can be seen in the Machine Learning Works folder and used the models to train and test the data.
- And then, I utilized from Python's library Sckit-Learn and applied the same tests and got the same results approximately.



## Arima Model
- I tried to evaluate the past data and according to that created a model that predicts the future data according to time.
- The data I took is in the csv file and can be seen in the Machine Learning Works.



## Classification Model: Decision Tree
- I used decision trees to classify the data I cleaned the data and took the related features as parameters to my model.
- The data I took is in titanic.csv file, it includes passangers personal information and their survival rate.
